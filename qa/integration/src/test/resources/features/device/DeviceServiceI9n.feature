  Scenario: Birth message handling from a new Device
  A birth message is received. The referenced device does not yet exist and is created on-the-fly. After the
  message is processed a new device must be created and a BIRTH event inserted in the database.

    Then No exception was thrown
    And The device matches the creator parameters
    And I logout

  Scenario: Create a Device with too long 'connectionInterface'
  Login as kapua-sys, go to devices, create a Device with too long connectionInterface.
  Kapua should throw an exception.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Account
      | name     | scopeId |
      | AccountA | 1       |
    And I configure the device registry service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 10    |
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalArgumentException" with the text "An illegal value was provided for the argument deviceCreator.connectionInterface: Value over than allowed max length. Max length is: 4096."
    And I create a device with parameters

    Then No exception was thrown
    And The device matches the creator parameters
    And I logout

  Scenario: Create a Device with too long 'connectionIp'
  Login as kapua-sys, go to devices, create a Device with too long connectionIp.
  Kapua should throw an exception.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Account
      | name     | scopeId |
      | AccountA | 1       |
    And I configure the device registry service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 10    |
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalArgumentException" with the text "An illegal value was provided for the argument deviceCreator.connectionIp: Value over than allowed max length. Max length is: 4096."
    And I create a device with parameters
